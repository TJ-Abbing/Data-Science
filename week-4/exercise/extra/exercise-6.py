Exercises 6:
Write a function that generates a string of fibonaci number up to the given number as argument.
If you do not know what a fibonaci sequence is, check this Wikipedia link:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence
Make sure that your function returns this error message if the argument is less than zero: "Invalid input. n must be a positive integer".
The string should contain all the fibonaci numbers with a space between each number.
