# Week 5: Lists and Tuples

# *** The first 7 exercises are simple and similar to the exercises we did in class. They are more for practicing what we learned. ***

# *** Please pay attention to the descriptions, in some exercises I ask you to write a function and in others I ask you to write a program. Some more practice with while loops. ***

# *** The last 3 exercises are for list reversing with slicing. ***
