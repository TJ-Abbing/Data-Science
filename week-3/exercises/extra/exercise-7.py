"""
Exercise 7:
Find if a number is a palindrome. A palindrome is a number that remains the same when reversed.
A few examples:
- The reverse of the number 84548 is also 84548. Therefore 84548 is a palindrome.
- The reverse of number 475 is 574. Therefore 475 is not a palindrome.

The number can have any amount of digits.
