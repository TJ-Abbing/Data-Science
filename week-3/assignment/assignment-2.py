Assignment Week 3
Well-ordered numbers are numbers whose digits increase from left to right.
for example, the number 1234 is well-ordered as 1 but 4321 and 122 are not well-ordered.
Write a program that finds and reports the total number of well-ordered numbers between the given 
range (start to end).
1. The program should only accept numbers greater than 3 digits, so if the user enters a number 
less than 3 digits, print an error message and ask for another number.
2. Create an integer variable called total that holds the count of well-ordered numbers.
3. Create a string variable called numbers_list and each time you find a well-ordered number,
add it to this string with an extra space after.
4. At the end, print a message like this "The count of well-ordered numbers between 1 IO and 130
is 7 and these are the numbers: 123 124 125 126 127 128 129"

Tip: You can use the % and // operators to separate digits.

Note: Try to use f-string formatting that we practiced in the last session for the message you print at the end.
• Write your code and submit your Python file.
• You don't need to comment all the code, just the lines you think need extra explanation.
